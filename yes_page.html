    <title>Omg you say yes and i will say this, I admit that you have a deep and sincere love, so much that even I am surprised. Although I’m not very good at loving, I still want to make up for everything you’ve been through all this time.

 I can be lazy, but when I’m with you, I always try my best and never leave you alone. I also really like your personality—you’re adorable and beautiful, and many people admire you. Even when others confess to you or ask for your number, you still turn them down.

 Honestly, I truly cherish you. I’m afraid that one day you might leave me or find someone else, but even if that happens, I will never blame you.

 No matter what happens, I will always try my best to make you happy. You are the most precious person in my life, and I will always be grateful to have you by my side. I love you more than words can express, and I always will. When I say these truths, I always feel shy when facing or texting you.

 Thank you for always being by my side. I wish you happiness, love, and all the beautiful things in life. No matter what happens, I’ll always cherish you. Take care and stay happy, my love!


 Dedicated to my Nini!...</title>
